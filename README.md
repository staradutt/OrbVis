# Orbvis

**Orbital-resolved band structure and DOS vizualization tool**

---

## Overview

`orbvis` is a Python package for visualizing orbital-resolved **electronic band structures** and **density of states (DOS)**. It is designed to work with output from VASP, and provides clean plots suitable for publication.

---

## Features

- Orbital-resolved band structure plotting (`orbscatter`)
- Partial density of states (pDOS) plotting (`plot_pdos`)
- Easy configuration via plain text files (Similar to VASP INCAR file)
- Modular structure with `band` and `dos` submodules
- Distinct orbital colors via `distinctipy`
- Command-line interface (CLI) support

## Installation

### Using pip (coming soon)

```bash
pip install orbplot
